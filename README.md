# WQI-Predictions

This code implements predictions of water quality based on various water parameters.  Note that the data for this implementation is not included in the repository.

This codebase consists of four files:
- `main.py` -- This is the entry point into the code.  Run this file.
- `utils.py` -- This file holds utility functions for processing data and models.
- `wqi.py` -- This file holds a set of functions for evaluating the actual water quality index (WQI) from provided data.
- `parameters.py` -- Any parameters for loading or using data, plus any parameters for model optimization, are kept here.
